## Requirement
Continuesly read tweets of up to 5 topics and save them in separated files.

## Investigate
Twitter Api can be used to read tweets.
ref: https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/tweets/search/overview
Using OAuth to do the authentication
ref: https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/basics/authentication/overview/oauth 

## Steps to implement.
### 1. Open twitter developer account
### 2. Get access token using customer api keys
ref: https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/basics/authentication/overview/application-only

## Highlight tech
### Spring boot, microservice/rest, oauth, RestTemplate, multi threads


## Design considerations
### 1. Separate thread should be used to read tweets of each topic.
### 2. ThreadPoolTaskExecutor is used to do thead pooling and support graceful shutdown of the application.
### 3. No Infinit loop is used for every topic reader to support recovering from errors easily.
### 4. UserDefinedFileAttribute is used to save last tweet id saved into the file so that it knows where we should start next time the app starts up.
